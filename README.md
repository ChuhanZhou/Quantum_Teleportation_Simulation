- [x] 1. Teleportation based on pure state qubit

- [ ] 2. Teleportation based on superposition state qubit
      
  - [ ] Relationship between information accuracy and superposition state  qubit number without noise `Visualisation`
        
  - [ ] Relationship between information amount and number of qubit (pure state, superposition state) `Visualisation`
        
  - [ ] The influence of noise(like Dephasing) `Visualisation`
        
- [ ] 3. Teleportation based on Continuous Variables
