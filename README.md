# Quantum_Teleportation_Simulation

- [x] 1. Teleportation based on pure state qubit
- [ ] 2. Teleportation based on superposition state qubit
  - [ ]   2.1. Relationship between information accuracy and superposition state  qubit number without noise `Visualisation`
  - [ ]   2.2. Relationship between information amount and number of qubit (pure state, superposition state) `Visualisation`
  - [ ]   2.3. The influence of noise(like Dephasing) `Visualisation`
- [ ] 3. Teleportation based on continued variable
